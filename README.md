# 🔎 Network Port Scanner (Python)

## Overview
A lightweight TCP port scanner built with Python to identify open ports on a target host and analyze potential network exposure.

This project simulates basic reconnaissance techniques commonly used in security assessments.

## Features
- Scans common TCP ports
- Identifies open ports
- Performs basic network exposure analysis
- Lightweight and fast execution

## Skills Demonstrated
- Socket programming
- TCP connection handling
- Network reconnaissance concepts
- Attack surface identification
- Security automation

## How to Run

python port_scanner.py example.com

## Example Output

[OPEN] Port 80  
[OPEN] Port 443  

## Why This Project Matters
Open ports represent potential entry points for attackers. Understanding how port scanning works helps security professionals assess and reduce network attack surface.
